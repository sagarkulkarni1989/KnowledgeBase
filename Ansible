How Ansible Works
Control Node --ssh ---node1 

Ansible Terminology 
Control Node: Any Machine with Ansible installed. 
Managed Nodes : The network device(Servers) you manage with Ansible 
Inventory : A list of managed nodes.An inventory file is also sometimes called a 'hostfile'
Modules : The units of code Ansible executes. Each modules has a particular functionality. 
Tasks: The Unit of  action in Ansible.
Playbooks: Ordered list of tasks.

Lab Setup 
Prepare Ansible Server 
	Setup EC2 instance 
	Setup hostfile
	Create ansadmin user 
	Add user to sudoers file --visudo 
	Generate ssh keys
	Enable password based login : vi etc/ssh/sshd_config
	install ansible

Ansible Componets
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg : 
all ansible Default configurations
All Ansible command refer default values while executing from ansible.cfg file
Main Purpose of this file o customize your confugurations.
remote_tmp= ~/.ansible/tmp  (Ansible required some space on managed node to execute commands, by default its under home/<ansible created user dir/.ansible>)
local_tmp=~/.ansible/tmp    
forks=5 (Ansible uses default server batch to execute any command)
poll_interval= 15  (Wait time on nodes, if its not recived any response,then its returns result , node is not reachable something)
retry_files_save_path = ~/.ansible-retry (not executed command node list)

What is Inventory 
Ansible works against multiple managed nodes or "hosts" in your infrastructure at the same time,usinga list or group of lists knows as inventory.
Inventory file is a collection of Hosts(Nodes) which are managed by ansible control node

	
Inventory /host : Managed server information
Tasks: which we are executing on managed servers
Playbook 

Ansible Basics 
All ansible commands start with "ansible"
Ansible default configuration file exists under /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
Default inventory file available under /etc/ansible/hosts
Managed Nodes information should be availale in inventory file.

Ansible Ad-hoc commands
Ping  Basic command to check the managed nodes connections
Command 
	ansible all -m command -a "uptime"  (we can provide any linux command)
				  "ls -lrt"
Stat  its will give you detailed statastic data about that file
	ansible all -m stat -a "path=/home/ansible/testfile"
yum : used to install software on target nodes
	ansible all -m yum -a "name=git" -b   (-m Module a= Attribute , -b become run the command as a root user)
User : Its used to create an user on target nodes
	ansible all -m user -a "name=modi" -b (-b)
setup : Gather all the system related information
	ansible all -m setup

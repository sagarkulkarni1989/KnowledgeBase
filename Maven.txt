Steps to Build Application 
- Compiling Source Code
	- App.java - app.class (Compiling App.java and creating .class)
	- AppTest.java - AppTest.class
- Run the tests
- Packaging jar/war/ear files

Maven Build Lifecycle,Phase,Goals
Maven build lifecycle is the set of tasks that are executed when the maven build is run.
There are three built -in build lifecycles
default Handles project build and deployment
clean Handles project Cleaning 
site Handles the creation of project site documentation
Maven build lifecycle goes 	through a set of stages, they are called build process.

Build Life cycle basics
there are three built-in build lifecycle: default,clean and site
the default build lifecycle handles your project deployment,the clean lifecycle handles project cleaning,while the site lifecycle 
Phases for default build lifecycle
- Clean  This command cleans the maven project by deleting the target directory
- validate This command validates the maven project that everything is correct and all the necessary information is available.
- compile This command compiles the java source classes of the maven project
- test-compile This command compiles the test classes of the maven project
- package This command builds the maven project and packages them into a JAR, WAR, etc
- verify  run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.
- install This command builds the maven project and installs the project files (JAR, WAR, pom.xml, etc) to the local repository.
 deploy This command is used to deploy the artifact to the remote repository

Maven Build Phases 
Maven build lifecycle goes through a set of stages, they are called build phases. For example, the default lifecycle is made up of the following phases.


 
The build phases are executed sequentially. When we run a maven build command, we specify the phase to be executed. Any maven build phases that come before the specified phase is also executed. For example, if we run mvn package then it will execute validate, compile, test, and package phases of the project.

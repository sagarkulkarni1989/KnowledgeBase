**************************Jenkins Interview qustions***************

Defile the jenkins process ****
Developer : commit changes to the source code report
Jenkins server: Jenkins check the shared repository at periodic interval and every check in is pulled and then build 
Selenium/test server: Jenkins deployes the build application on the test server
Production server: Build application then deployed on prod server.

Benifits of Jenkins
cache build failures
automatic build report notification 
Achieve continuous integration 
Automation of maven project 
easy tracking of bugs 
#####################################################
1] useful plugins 
   Maven2 project  Git Amazon EC2  Copy artifacts 
2] Maven is a build management tool,its uses a simple pom.xml to configure all the dependencies needed to build,test and run the code.
3] Start jenkins  jenkins.exe start , stop & restart 
4] Define post in jenkins: post is a section that contains several additional steps that might execute after the completation of the pipeline.
5] How will you secure jenkins   Authentication  Authorization  role based access control 
6] Pipeline in Jenkins  Pipeline pligin is used in jenkins for making the jenkins pipeline,which gives us the view of sages or tasks to perform one after the other in the pipeline form.
7] All the settings ,logs and configurations are stored in the Jenkins_Home directory.
8] What type of pipeline  CI CD pipeline Declarative pipeline
9] Pipeline as a code describes a set of features that allow jenkins user to define pipelined job processes with code,

Pipeline: User-defined model of a CD pipeline. The pipeline's code defines the entire build process, which includes building, testing and delivering an application
Node: A machine that is part of the Jenkins environment and capable of executing a pipeline
Step: A single task that tells Jenkins what to do at a particular point in time
Stage: Defines a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the entire pipeline (build, test, deploy stages)
agent 

Configure jenkins node agent to communicate with jenkins master?
two ways : browser and command line

Various Options to create Jenkins job.
1] Freestyle project
	This is the central feature of Jenkins. Jenkins will build your project, combining any SCM with any build system, and this can be even used for something other than software build.
2] Pipeline
	Orchestrates long-running activities that can span multiple build agents. Suitable for building pipelines (formerly known as workflows) and/or organizing complex activities that do not easily fit in free-style job type.
3] Multi-configuration project
	Suitable for projects that need a large number of different configurations, such as testing on multiple environments, platform-specific builds, etc.
4] Folder
	Creates a container that stores nested items in it. Useful for grouping things together. Unlike view, which is just a filter, a folder creates a separate namespace, so you can have multiple things of the same name as long as they are in different folders.
5] GitHub Organization
	Scans a GitHub organization (or user account) for all repositories matching some defined markers.
6] Multibranch Pipeline
	Creates a set of Pipeline projects according to detected branches in one SCM repository.
7] Copy from If you want to create a new item from other existing, you can use this option:

Various Configuration options in Jenkins jobs
1] General
		Discard old builds
			Build age: discard builds when they reach a certain age; for example, seven days old.
			Build count: discard the oldest build when a certain number of builds already exist.
		GitHub project
		This build requires lockable resources
		This project is parameterized
			Parameters allow you to prompt users for one or more inputs that will be passed into a build. 
			Boolean Parameter
			Choice Parameter
			Credentials Parameter
			password parameter
			String parameter
		Throttle builds
		Disable this project
			When this option is checked, no new builds of this project will be executed.
		Execute concurrent builds if necessary
			When this option is checked, multiple builds of this project may be executed in parallel.
			
2]Source Code Management
	Git
		The git plugin provides fundamental git operations for Jenkins projects. It can poll, fetch, checkout, and merge contents of git repositories.

3] Build Triggers
	Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)
	Build after other projects are built
		Set up a trigger so that when some other projects finish building, a new build is scheduled for this project. 
	Build periodically
	GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
	Poll SCM
		Configure Jenkins to poll changes in SCM.
	
4] Build Environment
	Delete workspace before build starts
	Use secret text(s) or file(s)
	Abort the build if it's stuck
	Add timestamps to the Console Output
	Inspect build log for published Gradle build scans
	With Ant

5] Build
	Execute Windows Batch command
	Execute Shell
	Invoke Ant
	Invoke Gradle Script
	Invoke top level maven target

6]Post Build options
	Build other projects
	Publish Junit test result report
	email Notification

How CI acheved using jenkins 
Split the entire chunk of codes into segments 
keep small segments of manageble code 
integrate the segmented code multiple times a day
adopt a CI methodology to coordinate with your team.

Blue ocean in Jenkins 
it is a project that was started with the purpose to rethink the user experience of jenkins,modeling and presenting th process of software delivery by surfacing information thats important to development team.

*********************************
1 Basic Cloud services 
Compute : To run any application, Control and manage server functions such as scaling and deployment. Ex EC2, Elastic Beanstalk,Lambda, Auto-scaling, Lightsail
Storage : It holds all the information which the application use. They additionally support archival compliance requirement. Object,file and block storage are the popular storage services ex. S3, Glacier, Elastic Block Storage, Elastic File system.
Netwrking: To control and manage the connectivity requirements for various AWS services: VPC, Route53, CloudFront
		
2] What is auto-scaling 
Auto-scaling in AWS allow you to configure and automatically provision and launch new instances whenever the demand increases.
Its allows automatic increase or decrease of resources capacity as per the needs	
How do you upgrade or downgrade a system with near zero downtime?
Open EC2 Console- Choose Operating System AMI-Launch an instance with new instace type - Install all updates - Install applications- Test the instance - Deploy the new instance and replace the older instance 

3] How do you setup a system to monitor website metrics in real-time in AWS?
Cloud Watch events helps us to monitor application status of various AWS services and custom events
	State changes in EC2
	auto-scalling lifecycle events
	scheduled events
	console sign in events
4] Type of EC2 Instances
	On Demand Instance 
		These are EC2 Instances that are purchased a the fixed rate per hours

5] Different between AWS S3 and EBS 
	AWS S3 : Object Store, Fast,Across Data Centers,Using Public and Private Key
	AWS EBS: FileSystem, Superfast,Can be used only with EC2
6] How do you connect multiple sites to a VPC?
	If you have multiple VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites the AWS VPN cloudhub
7] How do you monitor Amazon VPC?
	Cloud watch and cloudwatch Logs
	VPC Flow Logs

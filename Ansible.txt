What is Ansible 
Radically simple open source IT automation engine.
Advantages 
Simple 
	1] Human Readable 2] No Special Code skills 3] Tasks executed in order 
Powerful 
	1] Configuration 2] App Deployment 3]Provisioning  4]Orchestration 
Agentless 
	1] Use OpenSSH 2] Secure

How Ansible Works
Control Node --ssh ---node1 

Ansible Terminology 
Control Node: Any Machine with Ansible installed. 
Managed Nodes : The network device(Servers) you manage with Ansible 
Inventory : A list of managed nodes.An inventory file is also sometimes called a 'hostfile'
Modules : The units of code Ansible executes. Each modules has a particular functionality. 
Tasks: The Unit of  action in Ansible.
Playbooks: Ordered list of tasks.

######################################LAB Setup #################################################
Setup EC2 Instance
Setup hostname
create ansadmin user
add user to sudoers file 
generate ssh keys
Enable password based login 
install ansible

*******setup 3 instance 1] Ansible control node 2] Tomcat 3] rhcl
Common Steps in all the instances
1] Setup hostname 
		/etc/hostname 
2] Create ansadmin user
	useradd ansadmin
	passwd ansadmin 
3] add user to sudoers file to provide additional priviliges to your user
	visudo
	Add into below tag 
	## Same thing without a password
# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
  ansadmin ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

4]  Enable Paasword based authentication for ansadmin user 
 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 
 # To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
#PasswordAuthentication yes
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
PasswordAuthentication no

5] Reload the configuration  -  service sshd reload 

Below steps on Ansible control node server 
Now establish connection between ansible server and Node
6] Generate ssh keys for ansadmin user 
          sudo su - ansadmin  (/home/ansadmin)

(When we create new ec2 instance we download private key and in ec2-user in authentication key - public key)
Normal Ec2 Instance login process 
User(Private Key) -- EC2 Instance Public Key(Authorization Key)	
In Ansible 
Ansible server (Private key) copy Public key into managed nodes	
  
ssh-keygen    (just hit enter)
It will generate private and public key (id_rsa, id_rsa.pub)

7] Install Ansible
	Check pythod is installed or not 
		python --version
		sudo yum install ansible   it will give new command to install ansible 
		sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2
    Check the ansible version  ansible --version 
	  Default installation loaction : /etc/ansible
  8] Create ssh connectivity between ansible server and node
  copy public key file from ansible to node - authoriation keys
  ssh-copy-id ansadmin@172.31.17.192
 
8] Ansible Update host file with node details
ansible all -m ping   (-m stand for module)

ansible all --list-hosts
ansible <group name> --list-hosts

Ad-hoc commands, Modules and Playbook
1] Ad-hoc Command (No Idempotency)

	Ad-hoc commands are commands which can be run indivitually to perform quick function
	These ad-hoc commands are not used for configuration management and deployment because the commands are of one time usage
	Adhoc commands (Simple Linux commands can execute)
	Commands 
	ansible <group name>[o]
	[0] Means first server of group
	[-1] Means last server of group
	ansible demo -ba "yum remove httpd -y"

Modules (idempotency present) by default first setup module execute- its gather the information about nodes
	Ansible Ships with a numbers of modules(Called Liabrary) that can be executed directly on remote hosts pr through playbooks
	ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=present"  (for Install = Present , uninstall = absent and update = Latest)
	ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=latest"
	ansible demo -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
	ansible demo -b -m user -a "name=raj"
	ansible demo -b -m copy -a "src=file4 dest=/tmp"
	ansible demo -m setup 
	
Playbook  Both are written in YAML Language (Yet another markup Language)
	Playbook in ansible are written in YAML Format.
	It is human readable data
	Playbook is like a file where you write codes.Cosists of vars, tasks, handlers, files templates and roles.
	Each Playbook is compose  of one or more modules in a list module is collection of configuration file
	Playbook are divided into 3 sections 
		Target Section:  Define the host agaist which playbook task has to be executed
		Variable Section  Define variable 
		Task Section : List of all modules that we need to run in an order
YAML 
	For Ansible nearly every YAML files start with a list 
	Each item in the list is a list of key-volume pairs commonly called a dictionary.
	All YAML files hava to begin with --- and end with ...
	All members of a list lines must begin with same indentation level starting with "-"

####################################
Handlers Section  
A handler is exactly the same as a task, but it will run when called by another taks
Handlers are just like regular tasks in an ansible playbook, but they are only run if the task contains a notify directive and also indicates that it changed something.

Software Testing is a part of software development lifecycle,its aim is to ensure that the code to be deployed is of high quality with no bugs and no critical errors.

Testing Levels
	Unit 
	Integration
	System
	Acceptance
Static Testing 
	It is a method of debugging by examining source code before program is run.It does so by analyzing the code agaist a pre-set of coding rules and ensure that it confirms to the guidelines
Reasons to use static code Analysis
	Finds errors earlier development
	Detect overcomplexity in code
	Find Security Errors
	Enforce best coding practice
	Automated & integrated in jenkins 
SonarQube 
	Its an open source static testing analysis software.it is used by developers to manage source code quality and consistency.
	Potentials Logs
	Code Defect to design inefficiencies
	Code Duplication
	Lack of test coverage
Features of SonarQube
	Detect Bugs
	Code Smell
	Security Vulnerability
	Activate Rules needed
